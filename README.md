# DOM Manipulation with Local Storage

This project is an exercise demonstrating how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript, while utilizing the browser's **Local Storage** to persist data between sessions.

## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to show how DOM elements can be dynamically updated based on data stored in **Local Storage**. This allows data to be preserved across page reloads or browser sessions. The example focuses on:

- Adding and removing items from the DOM.
- Storing and retrieving data from Local Storage.
- Reflecting changes in the DOM when data is updated in Local Storage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Local Storage API**

## Features

- **Add Items:** Dynamically add new items to the DOM, which are stored in Local Storage.
- **Delete Items:** Remove items from both the DOM and Local Storage.
- **Persistent State:** Any changes made (e.g., adding or removing items) are saved and persist after page reloads.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
